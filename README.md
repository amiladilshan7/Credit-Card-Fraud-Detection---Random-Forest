# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection---Random-Forest

# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes transaction patterns and identifies potential fraud cases to enhance financial security.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains anonymized credit card transactions, including both genuine and fraudulent transactions. It consists of various numerical features extracted from raw transaction data.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION.ipynb
```

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness
- **Precision**: Indicates how many predicted fraud cases were actually fraud
- **Recall**: Measures how many actual fraud cases were correctly detected
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
